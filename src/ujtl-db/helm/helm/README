Before deployment, the pull secrets for git/bitbucket repos must be added to openshift.

To configure deployment, modify ./udb-app/values.yaml 
- make sure "sourceSecret" matches the name of the secret(s) created in previous step
- otherwise, this step is optional; deployment should work with default values

To deploy, run:
helm install <deployment name> ./udb-app
